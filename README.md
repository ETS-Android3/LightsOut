An Android mobile game based on the [classic puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)), developed in Java using Android Studio.

The goal of the game is deceptively simple: Turn off all the lights on the board. The challenging twist is that clicking one light will toggle the others, leaving you with a mess of lights. Sometimes there is only one possible solution (there is always at least one!).
