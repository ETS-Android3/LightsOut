# Description

An Android mobile game based on the [classic puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)), developed in Java using Android Studio.

The goal of the game is deceptively simple: Turn off all the lights on the board. The challenging twist is that clicking one light will toggle the others, leaving you with a mess of lights. Sometimes there is only one possible solution (there is always at least one!).

To play, choose a difficulty level (Easy for beginners) and simply click on one of the circular icons. The goal is to change all of them to the OFF (dark) position. Clicking one of these icons will also toggle the lights adjacent to it.
